                    kids and they said Come play with us. I was like……. Uh……. N...n….o thanks I be over here. They yelled at me Have fun!!! Weirdo. But then I saw one person acting just like me I think it was God telling me we belong together. But the
                    hardest part was seeing who would say hi first if I know me I wasn't gonna say anything but reality just happened to knock me upside my head saying Get out there fool and say hi DUH! So I said h..h i he said hi and then it just went
