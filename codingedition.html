                        “Computer software engineers apply the principles and techniques of computer science, engineering, and mathematical analysis to the design, development, testing, and evaluation of the software and the systems that enable computers to perform their many
                        applications.” Therefore, a software engineer’s job and skills are very important to their profession.
                    </p>

                    <p>One quality a software engineer should have is patience with their code. Also they should have passion and many more good qualities.
                    </p>
                    <p>According to <a href="http://www.arkhitech.com/15-characteristics-of-a-good-software-engineer/">Source#3</a>, a good software engineer has to be...</p>
                    <hr>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b><u>Passionate</u></b> The most important thing for a good software engineer is his/her passion for the field. This holds true for any field in life. The most vital ingredient for the success of any profession is the passion
                            for it as underdogs have always been traced back to passionate individuals.
                        </li>
                        <li><b><u>Determined</u></b> Developing and keeping track of software and programs is not a very easy task. Developing a database or even an algorithm can take quite a lot of time and more often than not, detecting complex bugs is
                            nerve wracking. A competent software programmer therefore needs determination to keep up with routine tasks efficiently.
                        </li>
                        <li><b><u>Team Player</u></b> There are seldom one man shows in the software industry, and most professional software engineers have got to work in a team. You may have to join one at your workplace or you may work with several distributed
                            teams situated throughout the globe. No matter what the case, you should know how to blend in with the rest of the team.
                        </li>
                        <li><b><u>Confident</u></b> It is obvious that the nature of work in the world of software is difficult, mind boggling, tiring, and may at times make you upset and want to give up, but good software professionals keep motivating themselves
                            from time to time by asking themselves questions like: how many people in the world could do it?, how would society get benefited once the problem is solved?, Wouldn’t I be a smarter version of myself once done with this?,
                            Isn’t there a smarter way around this problem?, Isn’t there an algorithm for this? Who would be smarter enough other than me to solve this? etc.
                        </li>
                        <li><b><u>Up-to-date</u></b> The world of software is continuously progressing at a rapid pace. There are new softwares, tools, languages, frameworks, modules and programs being released every day. When you’re working for international
                            clients and big companies, you have to be to up-to-date with the latest trending technologies.
                        </li>
                        <li><b><u>Efficient Time Management</u></b> We live in a fast paced world. Everyone is working on the watch. Software engineers are no exceptions. They are given big projects and are kept on a tight time leash. So a very important
                            attribute of good software engineers is that they should know that they’re on a clock and therefore need to manage their time wisely. You don’t need to bother about trivial details when you’re on a deadline to, say, set up
                            a whole database.
                        </li>

                        Also the training needed is according to <a href="http://www.careereducationadvisor.com/Computer-Software-Engineer-Career-Working-Environment.htm">Source#8</a> The majority of employers prefer to hire those with at least a bachelor's
                        degree and broad knowledge and experience with computer systems and technologies. While computer training programs are offered by systems software vendors like Microsoft, Novell and Oracle, they are not required in order to sit
                        for a certificate exam. However, many authorities feel that certification alone is not sufficient for most software engineering jobs. Professional certification is offered by the Institute for Certification of Computing Professionals;
                        this voluntary certification is available to those with a college degree and at least two years of experience. Additionally, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society is planning to start certifying
                        software engineers who pass an exam. The person should also be used to computers and be advanced with coding programs. While you code you will still have to keep learning because in the coding world everything changes fast, so
                        continuing this education is necessary for your job. Examples of places where you can study this education (according to
                        <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-best-colleges-for-software-developers-2014-10">Source#6</a>) are:

                    Which software engineering job you end up with will depend on how much coding experience you have. For example, if you don't have that much experience, it will be difficult to find a good job. Since I am a coder, I can find internships at the Girls Club
                    and classes at Nano Hackers Academy (a selective group). If you have lots of experience, it will be very easy to find a good job in this profession. But if you are beginner, you should take some classes to help you out on your way
                    to success. Your employment for this job will take some time, but you will work your way to the top.
                    <p>
                        <br> <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6CZqguWAAEropZ.jpg">The pay scale for a software engineer can range from high to low salaries. If you create your own company, your salary can be as high as $500,000 a year or more if
                        you are successful. For example, Mark Zuckerburg's net worth is in the billions. If you don't have your own company and you work for someone else, then your salary will usually be about $100,000 but can be higher than that, depending
                        on your title. [<a href="http://www1.salary.com/Software-Engineer-I-Salary.html">Source#7</a>]

                    <p>
                        The typical work environment depends on how far you have gone. For example, if you have started your own business, you can work from home or wherever you like. Or, if you work for an existing company, some employers will let you work from home and submit
                        your work by email. [<a href="http://www.careereducationadvisor.com/Computer-Software-Engineer-Career-Working-Environment.htm">Source#8</a> ] However, many computer software engineers work in an office and
                        interact with coworkers and customers as they attempt to improve their software for users.

                        In conclusion, a software engineer's tasks, qualities, and much more are very important to success. When it comes to all these tasks, coders come with these skills to survive a day's work. From a coder's tasks to their pay scale, a career in software
                        engineering is fun and rewarding. Coding is the next big language!!!
